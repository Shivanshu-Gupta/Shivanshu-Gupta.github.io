  abstract = "A rapidly growing body of research has demonstrated the inability of NLP models to generalize compositionally and has tried to alleviate it through specialized architectures, training schemes, and data augmentation, among other approaches. In this work, we study a different relatively under-explored approach: sampling diverse train sets that encourage compositional generalization. We propose a novel algorithm for sampling a structurally diverse set of instances from a labeled instance pool with structured outputs. Evaluating on 5 semantic parsing datasets of varying complexity, we show that our algorithm performs competitively with or better than prior algorithms in not only compositional template splits but also traditional IID splits of all but the least structurally diverse datasets. In general, we find that diverse train sets lead to better generalization than random training sets of the same size in 9 out of 10 dataset-split pairs, with over 10% absolute improvement in 5, providing further evidence to their sample efficiency. Moreover, we show that structural diversity also makes for more comprehensive test sets that require diverse training to succeed on. Finally, we use information theory to show that reduction in spurious correlations between substructures may be one reason why diverse training sets improve generalization.",

  title = {Unobserved Local Structures Make Compositional Generalization Hard},
  abstract = {While recent work has convincingly showed that sequence-to-sequence models struggle to generalize to new compositions (termed compositional generalization), little is known on what makes compositional generalization hard on a particular test instance. In this work, we investigate what are the factors that make generalization to certain test instances challenging. We first substantiate that indeed some examples are more difficult than others by showing that different models consistently fail or succeed on the same test instances. Then, we propose a criterion for the difficulty of an example: a test instance is hard if it contains a local structure that was not observed at training time. We formulate a simple decision rule based on this criterion and empirically show it predicts instance-level generalization well across 5 different semantic parsing datasets, substantially better than alternative decision rules. Last, we show local structures can be leveraged for creating difficult adversarial compositional splits and also to improve compositional generalization under limited training budgets by strategically selecting examples for the training set.},

    abstract = "While interest in models that generalize at test time to new compositions has risen in recent years, benchmarks in the visually-grounded domain have thus far been restricted to synthetic images. In this work, we propose COVR, a new test-bed for visually-grounded compositional generalization with real images. To create COVR, we use real images annotated with scene graphs, and propose an almost fully automatic procedure for generating question-answer pairs along with a set of context images. COVR focuses on questions that require complex reasoning, including higher-order operations such as quantification and aggregation. Due to the automatic generation process, COVR facilitates the creation of compositional splits, where models at test time need to generalize to new concepts and compositions in a zero- or few-shot setting. We construct compositional splits using COVR and demonstrate a myriad of cases where state-of-the-art pre-trained language-and-vision models struggle to compositionally generalize.",
