<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- Shivanshu Gupta is a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California Irvine advised by Sameer Singh and working in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. He is primarily interested in improving the systematic generalization and multi-step reasoning capabilities of NLP models. Apart from this, his research interests include question answering, semantic parsing, and knowledge distillation. Prior to this he worked as a Research Fellow at LinkedIn and Microsoft Research India and completed his B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Delhi. -->

Iâ€™m a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California Irvine advised by [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org) and working in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. During my PhD, I've been fortunate to spend time at [Amazon Alexa AI](https://www.amazon.science), [ASAPP Inc.](https://www.asapp.com), and the [Aristo team at AI2](https://allenai.org). Prior to this, I worked as a Research Fellow at LinkedIn and Microsoft Research India under the advisership of [Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/), and completed my B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Computer Science from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam).

My primary research interest is making large language models and agents better in-context learners and reasoners. Apart from this, I'm also interested in systematic generalization, semantic parsing, question-answering, retrieval, and knowledge distillation. My research has been recognized with a [Best Paper Award](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TVDooAZqkNObz5ysVhDFtqnnVHR-u8wqYvgix-gzPMs/edit#slide=id.g2e55907bbcc_0_65) at [NAACL-SRW 2024](https://naacl2024-srw.github.io/) and I will be serving on the Program Committee for the [AI and Scientific Discovery Workshop at NAACL 2025](https://ai-and-scientific-discovery.github.io/).
