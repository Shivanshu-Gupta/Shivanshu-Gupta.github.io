<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I'm a third year Computer Science PhD student at University of California Irvine advised by [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org) working in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am primarily interested in making NLP models generalize systematically like we humans do when we encounter a new utterance. Apart from this my research interests also include question answering, semantic parsing, and knowledge distillation. Prior to this I worked as a Research Fellow at LinkedIn and Microsoft Research India under the advisership of [Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/), and completed my B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Computer Science from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam). I have also spent sometime at Amazon Alexa AI.
